# Cafeteria Management System - Documentation
## Overview
The Cafeteria Management System is a JavaFX-based application designed to streamline the cafeteria ordering process. The application is built using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and uses MySQL for data storage. The system supports three types of users: Employee, Admin, and Customer, each with their own set of functionalities.

## Features
### 1. Employee Features:
- Registration and Login: Employees can register and log in to access the system.
- View Orders: Once logged in, the employee can see the list of customer orders.
- Serve Orders: Employees can serve customer orders. After serving, the order will be removed from the table.
- Search Orders: Employees can search for orders dynamically using the search field to locate specific orders.
### 2. Customer Features:
- Registration and Login: Customers can register and log in to the system.
- Place Orders: Customers can place orders by selecting a food item from the menu and specifying the quantity.
- View Order List: Once an order is placed, it will appear in the customer's order list.
- Payment and Change Calculation: Customers can specify the amount they are paying. If the payment exceeds the order total, the system will calculate the change.
- Remove Items from Order List: Customers can remove items from the order list.
- Prevent Duplicate Orders: The system ensures that customers cannot order the same food item more than once.
- Reset Order: The reset button clears the total, amount, and change fields, resetting the order details.
### 3. Admin Features:
- Manage Food Items: Admins can add, delete, modify, or update food items in the menu.
- Manage Customers and Employees: Admins can update customer and employee information (fields auto-fill upon selection) and remove them from the system.
- Admin Credentials:
  - Username: abasse
